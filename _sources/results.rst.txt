Results & Implementation
========================

This section details the performance of our custom DBSCAN implementation and visualizes the results on various datasets.

Algorithm Logic
===============
Implementation follows the standard density-based clustering approach:

1. For each point, we find all neighbors within ``eps`` radius using Euclidean distance.
2. If a point has at least ``min_samples`` neighbors, it becomes a Core Point and starts a new cluster.
3. Using a queue visit all density-reachable neighbors to expand the cluster.
4. Points that are not reachable from any Core Point are labeled as ``-1`` (Noise).


Visual Results
==============

We tested the algorithm on synthetic datasets that are notoriously difficult for distance-based algorithms like K-Means.

Moons Dataset
-------------

The "Moons" dataset consists of two interleaving half-circles. Standard K-Means would fail here by drawing a straight line through the middle. DBSCAN successfully follows the shape.

Circles Dataset
---------------

The "Circles" dataset contains a smaller circle inside a larger one. This is a classic topology problem.
